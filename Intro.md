# Intro/Preface
Hi, fellow human! This is the documentation for how to handle operations on our VPS/server. 

This may be useful for non-VPS users but this is mostly geared torwards our own. 

This guide includes: 

  - Creating a user
  
 - Putting your site into the Caddy server
  
  - and more! 
  
So... you should probably start reading the rest of this and learn how to handle things now. Enjoy!
