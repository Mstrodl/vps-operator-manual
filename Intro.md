# Memework VPS Operator Manual

Welcome! This is the manual in which we remind ourselves on how to not break our little server.

This may be useful for any other human being but this was made for us.

This guide includes: 

 - Creating a user
 - Backuping shit so we don't have so much data loss
 - Having fun in a *very unstable* server running Arch Linux
 - Putting your personal shit into nginx
  
You can start on whichever topic you want to see. Enjoy!
