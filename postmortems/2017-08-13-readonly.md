# August 13, 2017: Critical failure

On the night of August 13, 2017, all systems on the host failed due to the drives entering read-only mode

We believe it is a failure in our RAID controller, however since
it will take time for that to be sorted out, the container
our services run will have to be created in another host.

The order of events:
 - We were doing a change in our Git provider, from Gogs to Gitea
  - We didn't think GitLab would be a good option because of all the setup required for it.
  - Gitea already has a migration guide.

 - The container starts acting strange for unknown reasons.
 - File system went read-only, no operations could be done, all services
 started erroring because of that.
 - `systemctl emergency` was done, so that we could do checking on the host's drives
 - Some files (requested by users) were restored from the container to a safe space
 (I *think* its safe, blame heating for that)
 - Host was rebooted, we attempted to start the container but were unable to because of IO errors.
 - Host was rebooted (again) and we checked the RAID controller which reported an `OK` status.
 - Host rebooted into Proxmox, we ran a file system check and it reported a lot of errors
 like orphaned inodes and messed up directories without parents.
 
We are currently restoring Memework services on an older version of our host.

NOTE: generic sucks
